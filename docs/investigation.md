# Digesting crates.io

## What are special about crates in different categories?

On crates.io, the crates are put into [53 categories](https://crates.io/categories). How are they different in terms of # dependencies and dependents? Do we obtain visually different graphs for crates in different categories?

## Similar analyses as above, but for keywords?

Crates are also labelled with [~20K keywords](https://crates.io/keywords) in total. This is another way to give meta information about the crates. Assuming that the keywords are accurate description to certain aspect of the crates, we can observe patterns for crates on a more micro level, compared to the category analysis above.
